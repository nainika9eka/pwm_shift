# pwm_shift
Designing an 8-bit shift register with PWM output support using Verilog HDL


The Verilog code for the shift register module is contained in "pwm_shift_register.v."
The main project, which implements the PWM shifting module, is written in "pwm_generator.v."
The testbench code for simulating the project on Xilinx ISE is in "pwm_test.v."
